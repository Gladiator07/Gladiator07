### üõ† My Projects
- **[Text to Image Synthesis using Attentional GANs](https://github.com/Gladiator07/Text-to-image-synthesis-with-AttnGAN)** - A PyTorch re-implementation of the paper [AttnGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10485): Fine-Gradine Text to Image Generation with Attentional Generative Adverserial Networks. [[demo app](https://share.streamlit.io/gladiator07/text-to-image-synthesis-with-attngan/main/app.py)]
- **[Text Summarizer](https://github.com/Gladiator07/Text-Summarizer)** - A transformer based extractive and abstractive text summarizer supporting wide range of input formats. [[demo app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Gladiator/Text-Summarizer)]
- **[Healthify](https://github.com/Gladiator07/Healthify)** - a ML based website which predicts the disease based on the symptoms entered by the patient, also supports several disease diagnosis. [[demo app](https://gladiator07-healthify--home-jlmke9.streamlitapp.com/)]
- **[GPU vs TPU comparison for computer vision](https://github.com/Gladiator07/GPU-vs-TPU)** - compared GPU and TPU for computer vision applications using Google Cloud TPUs and TFRecords data format. [[results](https://wandb.ai/gladiator/GPU-vs-TPU)]
- **[HARVESTIFY](https://github.com/Gladiator07/Harvestify)** - a ML and DL based website which recommends the best crop to grow, fertilizers to use and the diseases caught by your crops. [[demo app](https://harvestify.herokuapp.com/)]
- **[JARVIS](https://github.com/Gladiator07/JARVIS)** - a simple voice assistant made using Python [[demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKtrHy0ERNA)]
