## Recent public work

- Participated in [WSDM Cup - Multilingual Chatbot Arena](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/wsdm-cup-multilingual-chatbot-arena) [results yet to be announced]: challenge was to develop a reward model (used in RLHF stage) for multilingual human conversations on the chatbot arena (formerly LMSYS). Finetuned LLMs as reward models in classification setting and used various techniques like multi-stage training (pretraining, finetuning), pseudo labelling, LoRA, QLoRA, efficient inference techniques, knowledge distillation, etc. 


## Talks
I was a speaker at inaugural **Weights & Biases MLOps conference ([Fully Connected 2023](https://www.fullyconnected.com/home)). You can listen to my talk [here](https://youtu.be/o4gekl0DxbM?t=1033)**.
